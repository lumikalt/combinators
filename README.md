# C++ Combinators

# Introduction

My attempt at writting the different combinators, using the names of [birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird). \
Sadly, you should be able to pass functions themselves into combinators' functions arguments,to compose those functions, but C++ doesn't allow to construct such a thing (at least easily?)
